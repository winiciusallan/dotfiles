### Variables configuration
include ./variables

include ./appearance

### Key bindings
include ./keybinding

### Output configuration
#
# Default wallpaper (more resolutions are available in /usr/share/backgrounds/sway/)
# Requires: desktop-backgrounds-compat, swaybg, jxl-pixbuf-loader
output * bg /usr/share/backgrounds/default.jxl fill

#
# Example configuration:
#
#   output HDMI-A-1 resolution 1920x1080 position 1920,0
#
# You can get the names of your outputs by running: swaymsg -t get_outputs
set $output_monitor HDMI-A-1

output $output_monitor pos 1920 0 res 1920x1080

### Autostart configuration
include ./startup

### Idle configuration
#
# Example configuration:
#
# exec swayidle -w \
#          timeout 300 'swaylock -f -c 000000' \
#          timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * power off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * power on"' \
#          before-sleep 'swaylock -f -c 000000'
#
# This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.

### Input configuration
#
# Example configuration:
#
#   input "2:14:SynPS/2_Synaptics_TouchPad" {
#       dwt enabled
#       tap enabled
#       natural_scroll enabled
#       middle_emulation enabled
#   }
#
# You can get the names of your inputs by running: swaymsg -t get_inputs
# Read `man 5 sway-input` for more information about this section.
input * {
    xkb_layout br
    dwt enabled
    tap enabled
    natural_scroll enabled
    middle_emulation enabled
}

# Include configs from 3 locations:
#  - /usr/share/sway/config.d
#  - /etc/sway/config.d
#  - $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/config.d ($HOME/.config/sway/config.d)
#
# If multiple directories contain the files with the same name, the later
# directory takes precedence; `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/config.d/20-swayidle.conf`
# will always be loaded instead of `/usr/share/sway/config.d/20-swayidle.conf`
# or `/etc/sway/config.d/20-swayidle.conf`
#
# This mechanism permits overriding our default configuration per-system
# (/etc) or per-user ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME) basis. Just create the file you
# want to modify/override in the higher-level directory.
#
# For example, to disable the default bar from Fedora configs, you'll need to
#     $ echo -n > "$HOME/.config/sway/config.d/90-bar.conf"
#
# Note the quoting, the $() and the arguments quoting. All the parts are equally
# important to make the magic work. And if you want to learn the secret behind
# the trick, it's all in the `wordexp(3)`.
